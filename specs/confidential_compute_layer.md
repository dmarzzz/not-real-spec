# Confidential Compute Layer

## Overview

The Confidential Compute Layer is responsible for secure delegation and execution of compute tasks within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). It provides the core infrastructure for protecting computations over sensitive personal data, ensuring that even cloud-hosted models cannot access or extract the data they process.

## Components

The Confidential Compute Layer consists of the following primary components:

1. **[Confidential Runtime (CR)](confidential_runtime.md)** - The TEE-enabled execution environment
2. **[Agent Execution Engine (AEE)](agent_execution_engine.md)** - The AI model and agent execution framework
3. **Attestation Service** - Verifies the integrity and authenticity of TEE environments
4. **Key Management System** - Securely manages encryption keys for data protection

## Interaction Flow

1. The Confidential Runtime (CR) boots in a TEE and generates attestation evidence
2. The Attestation Service verifies the CR's integrity before allowing operation
3. User data is transferred to the CR only after successful attestation
4. The Agent Execution Engine (AEE) loads models into the protected memory space
5. Computation executes within the TEE boundary with data confidentiality
6. Results are encrypted before leaving the TEE boundary
7. Cryptographic receipts document the execution for audit purposes

## Security Boundaries

The Confidential Compute Layer establishes several critical security boundaries:

1. **TEE Enclave Boundary** - Hardware-enforced isolation separating protected computation from the host system
2. **Key Management Boundary** - Separation between data encryption keys and the computation environment
3. **Model Isolation Boundary** - Separation between different AI models to prevent cross-contamination
4. **Agent Permission Boundary** - Capability-based restrictions on agent operations and external access

## Attestation Protocol

Attestation ensures the integrity of the Confidential Runtime before any sensitive data is processed:

1. **Quote Generation** - The CR generates a cryptographic quote of its state
2. **Verification** - The Attestation Service verifies the quote against known-good measurements
3. **Challenge-Response** - Interactive protocol establishes freshness of attestation
4. **Continuous Attestation** - Periodic re-attestation ensures ongoing integrity

## Key Management

The Key Management System supports the following operations:

1. **Key Generation** - Secure generation of encryption keys
2. **Key Exchange** - Secure protocols for distributing keys to authorized parties
3. **Key Rotation** - Regular key rotation to limit exposure
4. **Key Revocation** - Immediate invalidation of compromised keys

## TEE Technologies

The Confidential Compute Layer supports multiple TEE technologies:

1. **Intel SGX** - Software Guard Extensions with hardware-enforced memory encryption
2. **AMD SEV-SNP** - Secure Encrypted Virtualization with Secure Nested Paging
3. **Intel TDX** - Trust Domain Extensions for confidential virtual machines
4. **ARM TrustZone** - Security extensions for mobile and embedded devices (limited use cases)

## Implementation Requirements

2. **Memory Requirements**: Minimum 32GB RAM, with at least 8GB EPC for SGX
3. **Network Requirements**: Isolated network segment with strict access controls
4. **Attestation Service**: Highly available attestation verification service
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for security events and anomalies

## Security Guarantees

The Confidential Compute Layer provides the following security guarantees:

1. **Data Confidentiality**: User data is protected from the infrastructure provider
2. **Code Integrity**: Only authorized code can execute within the TEE
3. **Execution Integrity**: Computation results are verifiably correct
4. **Access Control**: Only authorized entities can access data and computation results
5. **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged with cryptographic receipts

## Failure Modes and Recovery

1. **TEE Compromise**: If TEE security is compromised, the system enters lockdown mode and revokes all keys
2. **Attestation Failure**: If attestation fails, the system refuses to process data until attestation succeeds
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: If resources are exhausted, the system gracefully rejects new requests
4. **Network Isolation Breach**: If network isolation is breached, all active sessions are terminated

## Future Roadmap

1. **GPU TEE Support**: Integration with confidential GPU computing as technology matures
2. **Multi-Party Computation**: Support for secure multi-party computation across TEEs
3. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Migration to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
4. **Advanced Side-Channel Mitigations**: Enhanced protection against emerging side-channel attacks
